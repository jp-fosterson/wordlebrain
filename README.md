wordlebrain -- cheat at wordle
===============================

Wordlebrain is a tool to help you find good guesses for the wordle
word guessing game.  https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/. 
You tell wordlebrain what you guessed, and what hints Wordle 
gave you back, it will suggest words that satisfy the hints.
As you tell it more guesses and hints, it adds them to what it 
knows and narrows down the list of suggestions

Input your guesses like this,

---

```
wordlebrain> guess TRAIN nyynY
```

Where:
* `n` means letter not in word, 
* `y` means letter in word somewhere, 
* `Y` means letter in in word at this spot.  

To start a new game, or start over, type `reset`.

To quit, type `quit` or `exit`

Commands
--------
* `guess <word> <hint>` -- give a guess and the resulting hints, e.g. "guess TRAIN nyynY".
* `reset`               -- reset the game state to start over
* `exit` or `quit`        -- quit the progam
* `show [N]`            -- show [up to N] suggestions
* `showstate`           -- show wordlebrain's internal state 
                          (for curious geeks)

How it works
------------

Wordlebrain has a list of five letter words it uses to start.  Each guess's hints create three kinds of contraints: a five-letter matching pattern, a list of required letters, and a list of excluded letters.  With each new guess, wordlebrain merges the new constraints with the existing constraints, applies all the constraints to the word list, and produces a new set of suggestions.

### What are those numbers?

Rather than present the suggestions in alphabetical order, wordlebrain gives each word a score designed such that higher scoring words should provide more constraint on the remaining words if applied as the next guess.  The score is a the sum of the positional letter frequency of each letter, with a penalty for repeated letters.

**Note**: the highest scoring suggestion is not necessarily the *best* suggestion.  You will still have to use your judgement to choose a good guess at each step, unless wordlebrain has narrowed your choices down to one word. (It happens!)

### See the brain's state

If you're curious, at any point you can look at the internal state of wordlebrain with the command `showstate`.  Here is the state from the end of the game above (`HERON`):

```
wordlebrain> showstate
== PATTERNS ==
re.compile('.[^O]..[^E]')
re.compile('...[^E][^O]')
re.compile('.E[^O][^N].')
re.compile('.E[^N]O[^R]')

EXCLUDE: {'U', 'C', 'T', 'L', 'Y', 'S', 'A', 'M', 'P'}
REQUIRE: {'O', 'N', 'R', 'E'}
```

To be shown as a suggestion, words must
* match all the patterns exactly,
* include all the required letters, and
* not include any excluded letters.


Guessing Strategy
-----------------

Wordlebrain can help in both easy mode and hard mode of Wordle.

### Easy mode

In easy mode, when you can guess any word at any point in the game, I usually guess `TRAIN` and `LOUSE` as my first two guesses.  Those words cover ten of the most frequent letters, including all the vowels.   After that, I will usually follow the suggestions from wordlebrain.  Sometimes, if those two guesses didn't provide a lot of hints, I'll add `PYGMY`.  After those guesses, Wordlebrain sometimes gives me the right answer immediately.

### Hard mode

Hard mode is where wordlebrain excels.  In hard mode you must use the letters that you know are in the word on each guess.  This constraint prevents you from picking other letters just to eliminate them. Choosing `TRAIN`, then `LOUSE`, then `PYGMY` is impossible.  In hard mode I'll usually pick the top wordlebrain choice unless it is a really weird word that I don't believe the Wordle authors would be likely to use.  This strategy rapidly whittles down the available suggestions.
